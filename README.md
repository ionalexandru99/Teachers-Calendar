# Teachers-Calendar

Through this project I experienced with different capabilities of the C# .Net Framework language.

The application uses as main entities three classes: Rooms, Teacher, Subject and Lecture.

The application is composed of one Main form containing all the buttons the user can interact with for viewing the data from the SQLite Database and manipulating the window.
All the forms used are opened in the main windows as an extension of the screen, giving the possibility to the person interacting with the window to use the buttons from the main form without changing the window.

Since the main window does not contain the original Windows navigation bar, the moving functions needed to be created so that the window can be placed in any place on the screen.

The application gives the user the options of visualize(show), add, edit or delete records from the data base, as well as serialize and deserialize as a JSON file the content of the data base.
